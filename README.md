# 🍕 Pizza Sales Dashboard (Angular)

This is a frontend web application built with **Angular 19** and **ng-bootstrap**, designed to visualize pizza sales data such as total revenue, quantity sold, and monthly trends.

This project was developed as part of a **24-hour coding challenge**, focusing on fast delivery, clarity, and clean architecture for a single-developer use case.

## 🚀 Features

- Pizza summary table with pagination, sorting, and search
- Filter pizzas by ingredients (multi-select)
- Charts displaying monthly total sales and quantity sold
- Toggle between summary and detailed insights per pizza
- Fast and responsive UI built with Bootstrap & Chart.js

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- Angular 19
- ng-bootstrap (UI components)
- Chart.js (for data visualization)
- RxJS
- TypeScript
- CSS / Bootstrap

---

## 🧪 Getting Started
### 1. Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+

- Angular CLI v17+

### 2. Install Dependencies

- npm install
### 3. Run Locally

- ng serve
### 4. Then open your browser to:
- http://localhost:4200

## 🧠 Design Notes

- Server-side pagination, filtering, and sorting were implemented to keep things fast and scalable on the backend. This helped reduce the complexity needed on the frontend while still handling large data sets efficiently.

- Since this was built within a 24-hour timeframe, I prioritized speed and clarity over long-term structure. That’s why I used a simple folder layout (`/models`, `/services`, `/pages`) instead of a more feature-based or enterprise-scaled architecture.

I understand this approach isn’t ideal for larger or long-term team projects. That said, I’m always open to learning and adapting to best practices. Given more time or team collaboration, I can easily shift toward scalable patterns like shared modules, feature folders, or state management libraries like NgRx. 

This project reflects how I work under pressure, balancing clean code with rapid delivery while still keeping maintainability in mind.
